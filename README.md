### What is LINE?
LINE is an open source package to analyze queueing models via analytical methods and simulation. The tool features algorithms for the solution of open queueing systems (e.g., M/M/1, M/M/k, M/G/1, ...), open and closed queueing networks, and layered queueing networks. 

### License
LINE is released as open source under the [BSD-3 license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imperial-qore/line-solver/main/matlab/LICENSE).
